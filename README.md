>[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) to the rescue!
>1. [Website](http://materializecss.com/) provides everything you need.

#### Initial Setup of website :octocat:

1. Setup **firebase** initial project structure.
2. Add **Materialize** to the project structure.

#### Components used in the website :octocat:

1. [Navbar](http://materializecss.com/navbar.html) with Mobile collapse button.
  * Note: Navbar will be added in every page since it's a multipage website, therefore creating a seperate html with nav element and then importing it to all the pages is handy.
  * Follow [this](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/) for knowing how to use html imports.
