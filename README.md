>1. [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) Best for getting started.
>2. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meofoNuK3vo) Getting started with firebase hosting.

I have hosted my website using firebase, as my website is going to be a multiple page website with a blog, and for future proofing. Using firebase also ensures that you can add any number of functionalities to the website later like [real-time database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/), [chat](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/#0), and lot more cloud functionalities with [google cloud](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/). See a full list of functionalities [here](https://firebase.google.com/features/). All comes with a full documentation and a lot of tutorials to start with.

**+Getting started with html and css in minimum amount of time**

>Best tutorials to get a lot of knowledge without wasting much time. Best if you have Coding background and just wanted a site and not going to be a web developer in long run.
>Best for researcher and enthusiasts who is just going to create a single website in his lifetime.
>1. [HTML5 Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KlJn1pMYPVV3eYzxJlWcON)
>2. [CSS Basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IOmy04kDxh_hqODMqoeeCy)

**+Now HTML and CSS is huge and designing the whole website by writing whole HTML and CSS rules is not in our plate, as are not front-end developers, So what do we do?**

>[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) to the rescue!
>1. [Website](http://materializecss.com/) provides everything you need.
>2. [Tutorials Point](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/materialize/) alternative, but start with Website.

#### Initial Setup of website :octocat:

1. Setup **firebase** initial project structure.
2. Add **Materialize** to the project structure.

#### Components used in the website :octocat:

1. [Navbar](http://materializecss.com/navbar.html) with Mobile collapse button.
  * Note: Navbar will be added in every page since it's a multipage website, therefore creating a seperate html with nav element and then importing it to all the pages is handy.
  * Follow [this](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/) for knowing how to use html imports.
  
2. [Slider](http://materializecss.com/media.html) i.e. image carousel

![alt Image Carousel](https://github.com/deepaksood619/MyWebsite/blob/master/markdown/image_carousel.gif "Read to grow")

3. Grid image view for displaying gallery of images.

### Final Commit

#### My final about page

![alt Final About Page](https://github.com/deepaksood619/MyWebsite/blob/master/markdown/about.png "Read to grow")

#### Note:
>As i had gone forward with the project, i realized that using MaterializeCSS has some limitations as in the whole CSS part. Beside being bulky as you will not be using a huge part of already integrated css. Therefore i decided to stop the project here, as i am now comfortable with both html and css and somewhat media-queries(for responsiveness), so i will create the whole css from scratch without materialize

:sunglasses: **Why Dropped?** :sunglasses:
> The simple answer to this is that i never limit myself for mediocre things, i am not comfortable using something less when more is available. My only rule while coding is that **Never ever write BAD code, no matter what**.

> Don't limit yourself from taking the hard path, because then you will get used to it and always be mediocre.

> Most important thing that makes YOU you is your brain, so don't feed garbage to it. (Not talking about MaterializeCSS here, It's awesome by the way, just was not enough for me and i wanted to learn)

#### For a closing note, my Mantra-

**I am one with the CODE, and the CODE is with me!**
